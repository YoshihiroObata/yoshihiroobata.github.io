      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first part in my series where I make a piece of art based on my most recent publication. This is also the image you see in the banner of this site! I made this piece after writing my first paper, the review paper about synchrotron microtomography in bone because at the time I was very interested in climbing. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple and a bit amateurish, but I have a strong attachment to this picture because it combines two of the things I discovered and learned about after coming to Utah from North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quantitative Bone Imaging using Synchrotron Micro-computed Tomography</title>

      <description>All levels of the unique hierarchical structure of bone contribute to its characteristic toughness and material properties. Elements of bone&amp;rsquo;s density and size contribute to bone quantity (or bone mass), whereas elements of bone&amp;rsquo;s material composition, material properties, internal structure, and organization describe bone quality. Bone quantity and quality can be degraded by factors such as aging, disease, treatments, and irradiation, compromising its ability to resist fracture and sustain loading. Accessing the morphology and architecture of bone at the microscale to quantify microstructural features and assess the degree of mineralization and path of crack propagation in bone provides crucial information on how these factors are influencing bone quantity and quality.</description>
