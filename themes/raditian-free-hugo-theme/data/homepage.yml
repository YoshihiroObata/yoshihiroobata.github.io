  enable: true
  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I enjoy coding deep learning and machine learning solutions to grand problems. 
    So far, I have focused on denoising and segmenting micro-CT images to reduce the radiation dose required for each scan. 
    I love collaborating at the crossroads of several fields!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Spending time with family and friends is super important for me. As far as hobbies, I currently love running and playing the game Slay the Spire, 
    though I also actively play tennis, climb, and ski! Going into the outdoors for hiking is the ideal way for me to spend the weekend.

  title: "Experience"
  description: "Over 6+ years of research experience at multiple universities and NASA, and currently seeking opportunies to contribute to an impactful technology company. I implement and develop machine learning solutions for scientific images now, but am open to application of deep learning in all spaces. So far, I've primarily worked on CT scans, which you can read about in the projects section below. I also have extensive experience performing mechanical tests, such as toughness and fatigue tests at UC San Diego, University of Utah, and NASA. I tested the structural integrity of bone and how it is compromised by disease."
