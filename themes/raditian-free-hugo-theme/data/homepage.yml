# about
about:
  enable: true
  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I enjoy coding deep learning and machine learning solutions to grand problems. 
    So far, I have focused on denoising and segmenting micro-CT images to reduce the radiation dose required for each scan. 
    I love collaborating at the crossroads of several fields!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Spending time with family and friends is super important for me. As far as hobbies, I currently love running and playing the game Slay the Spire, 
    though I also actively play tennis, climb, and ski! Going into the outdoors for hiking is the ideal way for me to spend the weekend.
